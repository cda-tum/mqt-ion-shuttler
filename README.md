# MQT IonShuttler

The MQT IonShuttler is a tool for generating shuttling schedules for trapped-ion
quantum computers with a grid-type Memory Zone based on the Quantum Charge
Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture. It is part of the
[_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io).

  </a>
</p>

## Key Features

- **Exact shuttling schedules** for small architectures with
  **a single processing zone (PZ)**
- **Heuristic shuttling schedules** for larger devices with
  **one _or_ multiple processing zones**

## Contributors and Supporters

The _[Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)](https://mqt.readthedocs.io)_ is developed by
the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the
[Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and supported by
[MQSC](https://mq.sc). Among others, it is part of the
[Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de/research/research-areas/mqss)
ecosystem, which is being developed as part of the
[Munich Quantum Valley (MQV)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de) initiative.

## Getting Started

`mqt.ionshuttler` is available via
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.ionshuttler/).

```console
uv pip install mqt.ionshuttler
```

To print information about the usage of the supported scripts, run:

```console
mqt-ionshuttler-exact --help
mqt-ionshuttler-heuristic --help
```

**Detailed documentation and examples are available at
[ReadTheDocs](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/ionshuttler).**

## System Requirements

The MQT IonShuttler can be installed on all major operating systems with all
[officially supported Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).
Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux, macOS, and Windows
using the
[latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).
