# MQT IonShuttler

The MQT IonShuttler is a tool for generating shuttling schedules for trapped-ion
quantum computers with a grid-type Memory Zone based on the Quantum Charge
Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture. It is developed as part of the
_{doc}`Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) <mqt:index>`_.

We recommend you to start with the
{doc}`installation instructions <installation>`. Then proceed with the sections
below. If you are interested in the theory behind the MQT IonShuttler, have a
look at the publications in the {doc}`publication list <references>`.

To compile a Qiskit or QASM circuit for a one-dimensional hardware layout from
Python, see the {doc}`Linear compiler guide <linear_compiler>`.

We appreciate any feedback and contributions to the project. If you want to
contribute, you can find more information in the
{doc}`contribution guide <contributing>`. If you are having trouble with the
installation or the usage of MQT IonShuttler, please let us know on our
{doc}`support page <support>`.

## Overview

The MQT IonShuttler supports

- **exact shuttling schedules** for small architectures with
  **a single processing zone (PZ)**, and
- **heuristic shuttling schedules** for larger devices with
  **one _or_ multiple processing zones**.

The exact solution guarantees optimality but is limited to a single PZ, while
the heuristic method scales to many qubits and PZs. In the heuristic workflow,
an optional **compilation** feature (`use_dag`) allows for dynamic rescheduling
of gates based on the current ion positions and dependencies, potentially
reducing shuttling overhead compared to executing a fixed sequence.

## Usage

### Exact Solution (single PZ)

```console
mqt-ionshuttler-exact --help
mqt-ionshuttler-exact inputs/algorithms_exact/qft_06.json
```

The script supports an additional `--plot` argument to visualise the result.
Architectures and algorithms are specified in JSON files. For examples, see
[`inputs/algorithms_exact`](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/ionshuttler/blob/main/inputs/algorithms_exact/).

### Heuristic Solution (single & multiple PZs)

```console
mqt-ionshuttler-heuristic --help
mqt-ionshuttler-heuristic inputs/algorithms_heuristic/qft_60_4pzs.json
```

Architectures and algorithms are specified in JSON files. For examples, see
[`inputs/algorithms_heuristic`](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/ionshuttler/blob/main/inputs/algorithms_heuristic/).
